# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

## Introduction

Tailwind CSS is different from other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation, as it doesn't provide default components like buttons or cards. Instead, it offers low-level utility classes that allow developers to build any design, all without ever leaving your HTML.

## How to Use /

* There are different different ways to add Tailwindcss. The below one is using Tailwindcss CLI

**Step 1** : npx tailwindcss init (open terminal and run the cmd)

**Step 2** : Install Tailwindcss Extension in vs code 

**Step 3** : We have to provide path to tailwind.config.js for where we are actully writing the Content (Code)

**Step 4** : We have to connet the input and output css file with (npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch ) in your cmd or terminal 

**Step 5** : after Executing this all steps you will able to Use the Tailwindcss and see the suggestions as well. 

**Note** 

if you use 

- content : ["./xyz/*.html"]

-This will add css to all the file which is present in the xyz folder with extension .html. 


## Advantages

1. **Rapid Development**: Using utility classes can speed up the development process. Instead of switching between HTML and CSS, developers can style elements right in the HTML.

2. **Customizable**: Tailwind is highly configurable. You can define your design system (spacing, colors, breakpoints, etc.) in the Tailwind configuration file.

3. **Reduced CSS Size**: With the help of PurgeCSS (often used alongside Tailwind), unused styles are removed, which results in smaller CSS file sizes.

4. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind provides utilities for building responsive interfaces with ease.

5. **Plugin System**: If you find that you need a utility that doesn't exist, it's easy to write a plugin and add custom utilities.

6. **Active Community**: A large community means more resources, plugins, and tools built around Tailwind CSS.
